## Projects
* Semidefinite programming, binary codes and a graph coloring problem `Sep 2014 - May 2015`
  * Studied theory of semidefinite programming and CVX package to model and solve semidefinite programming problems;

  * Studied hamming scheme and the Bose-Mesner Algebra and Terwilliger Algebra applied on it;

  * Modeled the code size problem with CVX, solved it and generated the dual problem with scripts.

* New Exact Formulations to Solve Generalizations and Extensions of the OPSM problem `May 2014 - Dec 2014`
  * Implemented a mixed-integer programming model and corresponding solution approach for minGOPSM (a general version of the OPSM problem) to find all maximal MinGOPSMs that are statistically significant; 

  * The implementation was completed using C++ & IBM ILOG CPLEX Concert Technology, and its performance was tested on real biological data.

* On the combinatorics of Binary series parallel graph `May 2014 - Dec 2014`
  * Using symbolic method described the structure of binary series parallel graph.

  * Based on the original structural equation, derived several generating functions and new structural equations related to this graph.

  * Get the analytic properties based on the generating functions.

* Network protocol simulation and applications `Feb 2014 - May 2014`
  * Emulated the selective repeat algorithm and go back N algorithm of TCP protocols, running on a emulated linked layer.

  * Implemented a chat application with server and client using Linux sockets with the ability to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

* Parallelize the convolution based Ultra-sound image emulation algorithm `May 2013`
  * Studied the convolution based Ultra-sound image emulation algorithm.

  * Parallelized the CPU implementation taking advantage of CUDA.

  * The GPU version algorithm could be used in product with the ability of real-time response, which was 10 times faster than the CPU implementation on NVIDIA GTX 660. 

* Study on the pair-wisely orthogonal Latin Squares `Sep 2011 - May 2012`
  * Undergraduate major qualified project.

  * Learned and implemented X algorithm with Dancing Links structure used to solve exact cover problems efficiently.

  * Applied the algorithm into searching for pair-wisely orthogonal Latin Squares.

* Study on the object tracking algorithms in video `Sep 2009 - Jul 2011`
  * Studied and implemented the Mean Shift and Particle filter algorithms, used for object tracking in video. 

  * Blended the two algorithms for both the advantages of them.

  * Algorithms are implemented in C++ with OpenCV.
